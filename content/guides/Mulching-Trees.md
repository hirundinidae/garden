# Mulching Trees

## Description

Mulching is when we place organic material around the trees in the neighborhood. We have a variety of pear and apple trees that require mulching each year.
In the spring, the garden facilitator will organize days to mulch. Ideally the weather is warm and not raining.

## Steps

### Preparation
Materials needed:
- wheelbarrow

- mulch

- gardening gloves
- shovel

### Mulching

1. Form groups of 2, if possible. Assign trees to groups of volunteers.

2. Load mulch into a wheelbarrow

3. At a tree, use the shovels to transfer mulch from the wheelbarrow to the ground around the trees. Try to form a tall donut whose circumference is 12 inch
es away from the trunk of the tree.
