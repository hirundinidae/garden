## Description 
The garden sometimes doesn't have direct access to a water source. This is a brief description of how to obtain water. 

## Method 1: Connect to building 
### Preparation 
Materials needed: 
- Hoses 

### steps:
1. Retrieve the hoses 
2. Connect hoses in series and to the outdoor hose spout 
3. place the other end of the hoses in the water tank 
4. When the water tank is full, turn off the water, disconnect the hoses, and return to storing place. 
5. Get water for your garden with a small watering container (like a watering can) by opening the spout slighty on the water tank. Remember to turn off the tank 

## Method 2: Collect rainwater 
Investigate the possibility of collecting rain water directly into the water tanks. Watering individual plots would occur the same way as Method 1
