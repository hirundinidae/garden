## Description 
Mulching is when we place organic material around the trees in the neighborhood. We have a variety of pear and apple trees that require mulching each year. In the spring, the garden facilitator will organize days to mulch. Ideally the weather is warm and not raining. 

## Steps
### Preparation 
Materials needed: 
- wheelbarrow 
- mulch 
- gardening gloves 
- shovel 

### Mulching
1. Form groups of 2, if possible. Assign trees to groups of volunteers. 
2. Load mulch into a wheelbarrow 
3. At a tree, use the shovels to transfer mulch from the wheelbarrow to the ground around the trees. Try to form a tall donut whose circumference is 12 inches away from the trunk of the tree.
