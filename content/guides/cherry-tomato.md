## Steps
### Preparation 
You will need: 
- 1 cherry tomato plant 
- 1 bag potting mix (20l) 1 bottle or bag tomato food 
- 1 big (plastic or other) food bucket (20l) 
- 1 tomato cage - to support the plant

### How-To 
1. Drill holes (about 1/2 cm) around the bottom edge of the bucket, plus some in the bottom to let excess water escape. 
2. place in a suitable location. The more sun the better. 
3. If you use a tomato cage, put it into the bucket around the tomato plant. Fill the bucket with potting mix, almost up to the rim
4. Water until the potting mix is moist. 
5. Dig a hole in the center of the potting mix. Carefully take your tomato plant from its original pot, and place it in the hole, planting it deep enough so only the top four to six leaves show once you cover it back up with potting mix. 
6. Water every two or three days to keep the soil evenly moist (in hot, dry weather you may need to water every day). Once a week, feed your plant organic fertilizer according to the label directions. 
7. As the plant grows, the branches will start to poke through the holes in your tomato cage. Push them back inside so the plant doesn't droop.
